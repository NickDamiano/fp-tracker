2- Just create the table with the datatables thing
3- create the poller
4- write the tests
5- clean up code methods
6- see about refactoring logic into a fat model? not sure if it makes sense to keep the model thin. or maybe i need to make the model super thin.
7-See about the other types of test (controller test and integration test)
8- clean up gemfile

19 - add ability to create a new user through text message registration
20 - possibly remove the admin piece that checks the location of everyone - at least get rid of the hacky thing you did and make it work right or just pull it out completely and modify the code that checks. just add a note that's where the code would be.
21 - make a demo video for the quick version and long version
22- make a tutorial on how to use the text messaging thing and do tests with it
