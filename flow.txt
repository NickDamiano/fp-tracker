When the submit button is click

1) Grab what's in the textbox
2) Reject it if it violates the length/characters
3) Post a message, no special characters, must be less than 160 characters
4) If it passes, send it to notifications controller as params
5) Verify input of params to make sure no special characters and not too big
6) Let it hit the controller and do its thing
7) Where does the message that responds get sent? Somehow send that message back which is 
appended to the text box messages. 
8) When the backend database changes, it updates the front end using action cable?


MVP

1) no fake phone on front end, just a table with employee data
updates are sent by phone. 
when back end changes, action cable changes it.
