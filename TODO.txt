TODO

1) write test for auto forwarding and method
2) add controller method which calls that method if the line begins with 911





biggest things - duplicate handler, web page and authentication and front end test for creating a form to update names and data with drop downs. Also having texts pass back and forth between ricci/matt and whoever sends them. 

I forgot about the scenario where someone mispells a name. 

beyond that, the emergency, and other texts should be relatively simple. 

3 - add sitrep
4 - add emergency
5 - add duplicate handler (biggest point - also check duplicate against phone number. If number matches the duplicate name then assume that's the right of the duplicates. )
6 - add "Add employee"
7 - add "remove employee"
8 - add history of texts or maybe it's a summary so it will take text and sstore message in history as "nick, butt, fred, departed al yamama at 1900 driving to psab", "nick, fart, butt reported arriving at psab at 2100"
9 - toggle saudi presence
10 - toggle autoforward
11 - respond with instructions page for commands
12 - create page to enter in bulk employees or maybe new employee
13 - create authenticaiton
14 - create page to show all records and then click edit to modify them, add to add them, or delete to remove them
15 - Add ETA to depart
16 - If you just send "going to psab" it recognizes the number being sent and gets the person and updates them
17 - If more than one person texts the same people going to the same place, it creates all possible messages, but then when that employee is texted
as arriving, it removes all instances of them in the transit table. and then if someone texts arrived and there are no one in the table, then it doesn't
throw an error.
